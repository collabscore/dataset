# Dataset

This repository contains the reference dataset produced by the CollabScore project to test and evaluate Optical Music Recognition. It combines a set of images of music scores, all accessible and transformable through an IIIF server, the corresponding list of score encodings in MEI, and a few useful tools to set up a testing environment dedicated to Optical Music Recognition systems.
